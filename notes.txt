What is Typescript
1. superset of js created by ms
2. allows static strict typing
3. extra features-interfaces,enums,tuples,generics
4. supports es6
5. based on .NET harmony specefications

What's wrong with js
1. not suitable for large app
2. lacks strong typing
3. weird iheritance, unfamiliar syntax
4. only errors during runtime
5. suffers type coercion

Benefits of ts
1. typescript =  js
2. complies to js - runs everywhere
3. familiar oop programming
4. new features work everywhere

// types of variable in ts -> number, string, boolean

// normal:   numbers: number[]
// generic:  numbers: Array<number>

// type alias
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};


// define function return type
// by default function return type is void
function login(userData: User): User {
  return userData;
}
